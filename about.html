        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm MusicalPlayz, a YouTuber, gamer, and aspiring software engineer! ðŸš€</p>
        <p>I started programming in September 2024 (the new school year), and so far, it's been fun! I've learned a bit of Java, JavaScript, and now I'm exploring HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>This website is a little portfolio about me, as well as a center to check out any upcoming projects (I'll be announcing them in the Announcements page) and Iâ€™ll be adding more cool stuff later!</p>
